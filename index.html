                    Introduction:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Volcanoes, who doesn't love them? (Assuming you're not too close to them of course). They're the most
                    explosive things on Earth, even beating out Nuclear Bombs. The TSAR bomb for example, the most powerful
                    nuclear weapon ever created, was detonated in 1961, with an explosive yield equal to 50 MEGATONS of TNT.
                    The flare (flash), from the explosion was visible from over 1,000 kmaway, and the blast wave circled 
                    around the ENTIRETY OF EARTH, THREE TIMES, glass windows even shattered 780 kilometers away.
                    
                    The most powerful volcanic eruption in RECENT history (past few thousand years), on the other hand, was 
                    the 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora, and had a yield of approx 33 GIGATONS of TNT. That is roughly FIVE
                    HUNDRED TSAR bombs. Roughly 100 cubic kilometers of rock was blasted into the air. So much ash lingered 
                    in the air that the global temperature dropped by 0.4 to 0.7 Celsius, for about A DECADE.
